Hi! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Andreas. I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor's program of Statistics and Data Science at the University of Munich (LMU) and I enjoy working on little side projects and AI-related stuff. Have a look around and enjoy!

**Project that I work(ed) on:**

- [**aoc-2025**](https://github.com/asuender/aoc-2025) - An attempt to solve all 12 puzzles from 2025s Advent of Code.
- [**aoc-2025-rust**](https://github.com/asuender/aoc-2025-rust) - (Currently private) A Rust port of my Python AoC 2025 solutions.
- [**cli-wrapped**](https://github.com/asuender/cli-wrapped) - A small TUI that beautifully summarizes your terminal usage! [^2]
- [**dockersize**](https://github.com/asuender/dockersize) - A simple webpage built with Next.js to get docker image sizes.
- [**next-beat**](https://github.com/asuender/next-beat) - A small web app showing the most listened tracks on Spotify.

**Plans for 2026 (currently on hold due to exams)**:

- [ ] Finish the [**AOC**](https://github.com/asuender/aoc-2025) exercises in both Python and Rust
- [ ] Build a small http server in C that is (at least somewhat) HTTP/1.1 compliant
- [ ] Port [**dockersize**](https://github.com/asuender/dockersize) to a CLI tool
- [ ] Build my own note-taking tool for the terminal with automatic syncing.

[^2]: this was mostly vibe-coded just to examine the limits of AI-assisted coding using Claude Code.
